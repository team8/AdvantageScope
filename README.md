Advantage Scope is the desktop application used to interact with our [AdvantageKit](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit) logging framework. It can be used to view logs from a file or connect to a robot over the network. Visualizations include line graphs, tables, and fields diagrams for odometry data.
